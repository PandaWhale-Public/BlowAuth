Why BlowAuth?
====================
There some well-known OAuth implementations that are already available, but we
wanted to make one which focused mainly on implementing the OAuth spec itself,
without any assumptions about the platform. We want to keep the core library
focused on handling only the construction of OAuth requests, and add support
for particular platforms via child classes. The project is very young, but it
looks like OAuth is here to stay, and we want to give developers a general-
purpose tool for integrating with any and every OAuth provider out there!
